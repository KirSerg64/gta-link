# Project Overview

This project introduces a universal, model-agnostic method designed to refine and enhance tracklet association for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT). The approach is developed primarily as an offline post-processing tool, but it can also be adapted for online use with a sliding window mechanism.

## Methodology

Our method is model-agnostic, meaning it operates independently of the tracking models used to generate initial data. It only requires the output from these models and performs tracklet refinement through two main components: the tracklet splitter and the tracklet connector.

### Tracklet Splitter

The tracklet splitter addresses the issue of impure tracklets that contain multiple identities. It utilizes a transformer model trained to detect the precise points at which tracklets should be split to correct identity mix-ups.

#### Training Data
The training data for the splitter model consists of impure tracklet results generated by a tracking model, compared against ground-truth data. Each trackletâ€™s appearance embedding features, derived from a Re-Identification (ReID) model, are used as tokens. These tokens, along with their frame indices (used as positional encoding), are input into the model.

#### Model Function
The model determines whether a tracklet is impure and identifies the frame indices where an ID switch occurs, suggesting where splits should be made. This task is analogous to a detection task where the "locations" of ID switches are pinpointed.

### Tracklet Connector

After the splitter processes the tracklets, the connector component takes over to link pure tracklets into cohesive units.

#### Implementation
The connector uses a clustering method that employs cosine similarity of the tracklets' appearance features to determine affinity between tracklets, facilitating effective connections.

## Application

While the system is developed for offline processing, its adaptability allows for integration into online systems through a sliding window approach, making it versatile across different operational settings.
